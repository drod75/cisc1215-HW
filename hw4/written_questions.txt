1. (5 points) Write a script containing a function that calls itself. The function does not need to accept
any arguments. What happens when you call this function? Do some research into what you see in the
error message â€“ what does it mean? Why do you think you got this error?
- We get an error, the error we got is a recursion error, this means that the function is calling itself infinitely, which is not allowed in Python.


2. (5 points) In class, we discussed how integer, floating-point, and string objects are not mutable. What
does this mean? If integer types are not mutable, then how is it possible to execute sequences of
statements like those shown below?
    a = 5
    a = 10
- The variable a was at first a reference to 5, when we set it to ten we simply changed the address it is referencing.


3. (5 points) Lists are a Python data type that contain sequences of values in a specific order. Consider
the following code example below that uses lists:
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list.append(10)
    print(my_list)
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 10]
Based on this example, do you think lists are mutable? Why or why not?

- Yes, lists are mutable because we are manipulating the list by putting the value 10 in it.

4. (5 points) Consider the following nonsensical decision structure (based on Monty Python skits):
if c > a:
 if c > b:
 print("Spam please!")
 else:
 print("It's a late parrot!")
elif a > b:
 print("Cheese Shoppe")
 if b >= c:
 print("Cheddar")
 elif a < b:
 print("Gouda")
 elif c == b:
 print("Swiss")
else:
 print("Trees")
 if a == c:
 print("Chestnut")
 else:
 print("Larch")
print("Done")
Answer the following questions:
a) (1 point) What will the script output if a = 1, b = 3, and c = 2?
"It's a late parrot!"
b) (1 point) What will the script output if a = 4, b = -1, and c = -1?
'Cheese Shoppe'
'Cheddar'
c) (1 point) What will the script output if a = 5, b = 10, and c = 3?
    Trees
    Larch
d) (2 points) Are any conditions impossible to trigger? Which ones? Why?
    Gouda, if it activates by a being less than b, after being introducede in a loop where a >b. there is no way that works.
