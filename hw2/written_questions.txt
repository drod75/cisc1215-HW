1. Discuss the following piece of code. Is it valid? What does it do? What does the variable x
contain once the code has executed?
    x = 1
    x = x + 1

    Yes it is valid, the first line sets a variable x to 1, the second line sets x to 2 by adding one on itself.

2. The Python print() function supports other keyword parameters besides end (which we
discussed briefly in class). One of these other keyword parameters is sep. What does the sep
parameter do? Write a brief program that demonstrates its use, and give the output.

    Sep is used to separate items by the specified string value, by default its string 
    but it can be set to a comma for example. For example:

    print('Big','Deals', sep=', ')
    output: 'Big, Deals'

3. Write a for loop that uses a string (such as "Hello, world!") for the sequential object
instead of a range object like we used in the lecture. Answer the following questions:
    a) What value does the loop index contain at each iteration?
    b) Why do you think you saw this behavior? What does this say about the structure of string objects?


    a)
    for chr in "Hello, world!":
        print(chr) #the nth char in the string
    
    b)
    I think this behavior exists because string are meant to be a sort of list of characters, so can behave as such.
    
4. Consider the following code:
    for i in 10:
     print(i)
    Does it work? Why or why not?

    This does not work since 10 is an int, 10 is not an iterable like a list.
