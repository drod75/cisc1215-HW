1. (2 points) In your own words, explain why we can change the contents of a dictionary contained in a
tuple, yet still consider the tuple immutable. For example:
    my_tuple = ({}, 10, 11)
    my_tuple[0]['hello'] = 'world'

answer: The reference to the dictionary is still the same, so we can still access it and change it as we please.

2. (3 points) In your own words, discuss how the immutability of a tuple allows us to interpret its
contents in a way we cannot with lists. In other words, why can we say that ("Steve", 123892,
"123 Fake Street, Brooklyn, NY") is a record of an employee containing their name, ID,
and address? Why is it a bad idea to make the same assumption about ["Steve", 123892, "123
Fake Street, Brooklyn, NY"]?

answer: The tuple is immutable, so we can't change the contents of the tuple, but with the list we can change\
the contents of the list. The tuple is more like a laminated record while the list is more like a piece of paper.

3. (2 points) If tuples are immutable, why can we perform operations like slicing and concatenation
with them?

answer: We are not modifying the contents of the tuple, but we are creating a new tuple.

4. (8 points) Specify whether a list or dictionary would be better for the following tasks, and why.
    a) A contacts app allows you to look up your friendsâ€™ phone numbers by name.
    b) Blackboard shows me the names of all students in CISC 1215.
    c) A weather station records the temperature every hour.
    d) A government database displays all addresses on 32nd St. in Manhattan.

answer: 
    For a, a dictionary would be better because it allows us to look up a person's phone number by name.
    For b, a list would be better because it allows us to look up a student's name.
    For c, a list would be better because it is in chronological order.
    For d, a dictionary would be better because it allows us to assign certain keys to certain buildings on the same side.
