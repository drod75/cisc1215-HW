1. (7 points) Consider the following code:
    a = Point(5, 5)
    b = a
    b = Point(10, 10)
        a) What is the final value of a? What is the final value of b? Why? (4 points)
            Point(5,5) is a, Point(10,10) is b
        b) At which line(s) of code are the values of a and b aliased? (1 point)
            Line 2
        c) Do a and b cease being aliased before the program ends? If so, where? (2 points)
            Yes, while a refers to point 5,5 b refers to point 10,10


2. (4 points) In class, we briefly discussed the idea that all data values in Python are actually objects.
With this in mind, consider the following code:
    a = 5
    b = a
    b = 6
        a) What is the final value of a and b? (2 points)
            a is 5 and b is 6
        b) Are a and b aliased at any point in the program’s execution? Where? (2 points)
            Line 2, b refers to a which refers to 5.

3. (6 points) Consider the following pseudocode depicting interaction with the Python console. The
pseudocode involves two classes, Professor and Course. The Professor class has one attribute, name,
which is the professor’s name. The Course class has three attributes: number (the course number),
title (the course title), and instructor (which should contain a Professor object).
    >>> prof = Professor(“Alice”)
    >>> print(prof)
    Professor name: Alice
    >>> course = Course(1215, “Programming with Python”, prof)
    >>> print(course.instructor)
    Professor name: Alice
    >>> course.instructor.name = “Bob”
    >>> print(prof)
        a) What should the final print() statement output? Why? (3 points)
            Professor name: Bob, the name in the instructor of the course now refers to bob not alice
        b) Draw a diagram of the Course object using the same diagram style we used to draw Point and Circle objects in class. (3 points)
            

                 Course                                                         Professor
                    Number: 1215                            prof ->               Name: 'Alice' then 'Bob'
       course ->    Title: 'Programming with Python'         
                    Instructor: prof

4. (3 points) Briefly discuss the difference between a class and an instance.
    A class is the idea of a car, while an instance is a Ford suv 2024 model, the class is a blueprint while an 
    instance of a class is an actual car that exists outside of concept.
